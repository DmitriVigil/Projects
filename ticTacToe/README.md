# Tic Tac Toe

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is **Version 1.0**, featuring a fully functional 2-player mode for local play.

**Author:** Dmitri Vigil

## 🎮 Features (v1.0)
- **Local Multiplayer:** Two players can play on the same device by taking turns.
- **Win Detection:** Automatically detects wins across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Draw Detection:** Detects when the game ends in a tie.
- **Game Controls:** Includes a "Reset Game" button and a "New Game" popup upon winning.
- **Responsive Design:** The game board adjusts using CSS Flexbox/Grid logic (`vmax`/`vmin`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the game board.
- **CSS3:** Styling, Flexbox layout, and responsive units.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation, game logic, and state management.
